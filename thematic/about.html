			<h1>About the Thematic Website</h1>
			<section>
			The theme of PhonPage will be related to the introduction of articulatory phonetics, including fundamental concepts of anatomy of articulators, place of articulation, manner of articulation, coarticulation and coarticulatory models proposed in modern linguistic theories. Ultrasound videos might be used to help understand some of the concepts above. 
			<br><br>
			For each session, the content will target at different aspects of articilatory phonetics; in the session of "Articulatory Anatomy," I will briefly introduce the organs and articualtors related to speech formation. In the session of  "Dimensions of sounds," the basic phonetic descriptions for vowels and consonants will be the focus, including the spacing division for vowels, and the place and manner of articualtion for consonants. In the last session, "Coartilation & Models," a more advanced issue regarding articulatory phonetics will be discussed. Coarticualtion is a complex realization of intended speech. Modern models related to coarticualtion will be briefly introduced. Issues and difficulties to model coarticulatory movement will also be brought up to the surface.
