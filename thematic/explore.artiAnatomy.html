						<h2>When it comes to speech, what will be the first thing popping up in your mind?</h2>
						<p>
							Effortless. I believe this is the first instinct for most of us when it comes to speech. Most people take "speaking" for granted. Production of speech sounds is almost par for the course. However, we never notice how much effort and planning we should do to produce a mere sound, not to mention a word or even a phrase. When we are to produce a sound, we will come up with an intention to form a speech component; then, this intention will direct the muscles of your oral organs, i.e. articulators, to move in a proper manner to reach the targeted sound. For example, if you are to produce the "p" sound for "pat," your intention will make you first move both of your upper and lower lips together to form a tight constriction without creating any vocal fold vibration to maintian the voiceless quality of "p." A release of the tight closure with a strong burst of breath will be followed to complete the production of "p." It is hard to imagine how delicate the whole process is if we take speech production for granted.  PhonPage aims to tell you the truth that speech prodcution is in fact a gift from nature, and to reveal the underlying mechanism for human speech organization.

							Articulatory phonetics (AP) is the subject that studies how speech sounds are produced, with a focus on the detailed articulatory movement and mechanism of speech sounds. It is a sub-field of phonetics, a branch of linguistics, which investigates how speech sounds are produced and perceived. Before we dive into the sea of AP, it is of importance to have some basic ideas about the fundamental tools that we use to produce various kinds of sounds; that is, our oral organs!
