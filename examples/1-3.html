					<h4>This is a heading for a paragraph.</h4>
					The current speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, Democrat Sara Gideon, holds a five-point lead against her Republican opponent, four-term incumbent United States Senator Susan Collins, according to a poll conducted by researchers at Colby College. The new survey found that 44 percent of likely voters would support Gideon, 39 percent would vote for Collins, 12 percent were unsure, and 6 percent planned to support a minor-party candidate.

					Likewise, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden holds a 12 percent lead over Donald Trump (50 percent to 38 percent) in Maine, with 7 percent undecided. However, in the Second Congressional District, the gap is much closer, with Biden netting 45 percent and Trump receiving 42 percent of the vote.
