			<h1> Facts About Chia Fang Cheng</h1>
			<section>
				<big style = "font-size: 20">Chia Fang Cheng</big> is currently a second-year master student at Linguistic Institute in National Tsing Hua University. She spent his college years in the Department of Foreign Languages and Literature in National Chung Kung University and developed her research interest in linguistics with a focus on phonetic studies. At that time, she joined the phonetic lab of Professor Li-Mei Chen and was trained to do basic phonetic analyses, such as data transcription, sound segmentation and labeling in Praat. She conducted a project of "Speech intelligibility and the production of fricative and affricate among Mandarin-speaking children with cerebral palsy" under the supervision of the senior Chin-Ting Liu in her second year.

				In her last year of college, she resolved to study this subject area as a profession; hence, she participated in the Study Abroad Programme for Future Scholars in the Humanities and Social Sciences sponsored by the Ministry of Education. Fortunately, she was granted admission to University of California, Berkeley as a one-year exchange student. During her exchange life, she not only cultivated her analytical skills and techniques to process linguistic data, but also strengthened her theoretical foundation in phonetic studies. In the seminar of "Phonetic theory," she gave out her first try in designing a perceptual experiment to testify one of the controversial claim proposed by modern speech perception theories, which then became the topic for her term project, as well as her future research focus, since she found using experimental design in theory-testing to be really attractive.

				She knows if she is going to concentrate in this research area, she should be well acquainted with formal linguistic theories, statistic methods, experimental design and operation skills. As a result, she joined the phonetic lab led by Professors Yue Chin Chang and Feng Fan Hsieh in Tsing Hua University, and continues to educate herself on the emerging experimental design trends and to gain practical experiences in phonetically-related experiments, including ultrasound imaging and EMA. She now has experiences in not merely acoustic measurements, but also using ultrasound and EMA devices to access the actual articulatory processes and kinematics of articulators. Furthermore, to fulfill her  needs to efficiently collect and process data, she took courses in statistics using R and self-learned some fundamental coding skills related to GUI construction in Python.

				As a linguistic student, she is now on the way of being a <b>Linguist</b>. Even though she still requires more training and experiences in this subject field, her passion and energy in phonetic research will always guide her path to her ultimate goal.
