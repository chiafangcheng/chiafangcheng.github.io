			<h1> Autobiography</h1>
			<section>
				My name is Chia Fang Cheng. I am determined to be a phonetician with a focus on experimental phonetics and cross-language speech perception. I’ve been studied in University of California for one year, and currently a second-year master student at Linguistic Institute in National Tsing Hua University. </br>
			</br>
				I was born and raised in Alian, Kaohsiung. In my college years, I developed an interest in linguistics, experimental phonetics in particular. To establish a solid theoretical basis and practical skills for this field, I decided to join the Phonetic Lab after I was admitted to the Linguistic Institute of Tsing Hua University. A continuous training in running phonetic experiments (e.g. EMA and ultrasound studies) provides me with adequate hands-on experiences and improves my analytical skills. During this course, I also took courses regarding statistical analysis and participated in study groups about programming. Interdisciplinary learning widens my future career path in linguistic studies. </br>	
			</br>
				Beyond academics, prose writing is part of my hobbies. My article related to Taiwanese culture was selected as an Honorable Mention in 2012 Writing Composition held by National Museum of Taiwanese Literature. In 2014, I won the Kaohsiung Youth Literary Awards. Most of the time, I take up my pen to depict the moving moments in my life, and share the stories by submitting my prose pieces to newspapers. Writing makes my life peaceful and develops my spiritual gifts. 
				</br>
			</br>
				In the future, I will keep on writing and following my passion in linguistics. Even though I still require more training and experiences in this subject field, my passion in phonetic research will always guide me to my ultimate goal.

			<h1>自傳</h1>
			<section>
				
				我是鄭佳方，目前就讀於清華大學語言所。語言學於我而言猶如魚之於水，早已密不可分。大學時期，我初次在課堂上接觸此領域，並在學習過程中不斷發展出興趣。這份熱忱使我下定決心成為一位語言學家，並以語音學為重心持續探索。為了增進自己的學術能力，我加入了語音實驗室，並在教授的指導下進行多項構音實驗的操作和分析。同時，因為分析需求，我也進修了統計課及程式設計，希望可以應用所學，在語言學研究上紮實前進。

				學習之餘，我也不忘寫作。將情感轉換為文字吐露，昇華思緒的靈動。這份感動至今一直陪伴著我，讓我在疲累之餘得以繼續堅持。希望未來我可以繼續在寫作和語言學的陪伴下不斷提升自己，自信前行。
