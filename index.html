			<h1>-About Me-</h1>
			<article>
				<section class="hidmeWords">
					My name is Chia Fang Cheng. Feel free to call me Anna! I was born and raised in Alian, Kaohsiung. I am determined to be a phonetician with a focus on experimental phonetics and cross-language speech perception. I’ve been studied in University of California for one year, and currently a second-year master student at Linguistic Institute in National Tsing Hua University.
					
					I have received continuous trainings in running phonetic experiments (e.g. EMA and ultrasound studies) in the PhonLab in NTHU. Simultaneously, I also took courses regarding statistics and participated in study groups about programming. Interdisciplinary learning widens my future career path in linguistic studies.
					<br>
					Beyond academics, prose writing is part of my hobbies. Most of the time, I take up my pen to depict the moving moments in my life, and share the stories by submitting my prose pieces to newspapers. Writing makes my life peaceful and develops my spiritual gifts. 

					In the future, I will keep on writing and following my passion in linguistics. Even though I still require more training and experiences in this subject field, my passion in phonetic research will always guide me to my ultimate goal.

				<h1>- Creative Piece: Story Telling -</h1>
				<section class="hidmeWords">
					
					Making a story is an adventure. I feel honored to share one of my pieces here. The story, "The Duke's Happy Birthday," is a creative piece redolent of Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess.”  This story aims to explore how fragile the seemingly unchangable truths, friendship, and human nature are. The world in the eyes of The Duke is never dark until he unveils the dark side of human minds. Hatred and resentment blind him, causing an inevitable tragedy in the end. <br>I tried to expose the murky underbelly of human beings from different perspectives; the gossips from maids of The Duke and the sorbid tricks played by crews are all reflecions of the treacherous world. A bloody revenge maybe the only way out. The story seems to be tragic, yet the brutal retaliation redeems The Duke's soul and frees his blinded heart.
